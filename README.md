## User Stories

```
As a user,
so that I see what people are posting,
I would like to see a live feed of all peeps

As a user,
so that I can see more,
I would like to view an individual peep

As a user,
so that I can show my appreciation,
I would like to be able to like a peep

As a user,
so that i can spare my blushes,
I would like to be able to a delete a peep I have made

As a user,
so that i cannot be overly generous,
I would like the like button to dissapear once I have already like a post

As a user,
so that I cannot upset people,
I would like to only be able to delete my own posts

```
